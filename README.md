Project Reflection
How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I begin by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and identifying the requirements of the project. I focus on clarity in structure, planning how each component will interact with the others, and ensuring that the design supports scalability and maintainability. I also keep the end user in mind, making sure the design choices lead to a smooth and intuitive experience.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Through this project, I strengthened my ability to plan 3D environments by considering spatial relationships, object composition, and lighting. I learned how to incorporate textures and materials in a way that enhances realism while still keeping performance in mind. I also gained practice in using abstraction to manage complex features more efficiently.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process. First, I laid out a simple framework with basic shapes to define the scene. Next, I added more detail, textures, and lighting to improve realism. Finally, I refined the design by troubleshooting problems such as scaling, object alignment, and rendering artifacts. Each stage of refinement built on the previous one until I achieved the final scene.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The iterative design process can be applied to future projects by starting small, testing often, and building complexity gradually. This helps reduce errors and makes it easier to pivot when new requirements or challenges arise. Breaking problems into smaller tasks also ensures progress is steady and manageable, which is valuable in both academic and professional work.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach programming with a focus on modularity and testing. I break tasks into smaller functions or classes, test them individually, and then integrate them into the larger program. I also rely on incremental development, ensuring that each part of the program works before moving forward.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

During this project, I practiced using incremental builds to gradually layer in complexity. I also improved my debugging process by visually inspecting the 3D renderings for errors and then backtracking through the code to identify and fix issues. Additionally, I used version control to track changes and prevent setbacks.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was a central part of my process. I created a simple scene first, then improved it by adding textures, adjusting lighting, and modifying object placement. Each cycle of iteration allowed me to test and refine, ensuring that mistakes were caught early and improvements were steadily made.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Over the milestones, I became more disciplined in planning my code structure before writing it. At first, I focused heavily on functionality, but as the project progressed, I learned to prioritize organization, readability, and efficiency. This helped me create code that not only works but can also be easily understood and maintained.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and technical knowledge that are vital for my career goals. Whether in software development, game design, or data analysis, the ability to design and implement solutions efficiently will help me succeed.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics have taught me how to think spatially and mathematically about problems. This knowledge can support future coursework in computer graphics, simulations, or even artificial intelligence by giving me a stronger foundation in algorithms and visual data representation.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In a professional context, computational graphics and visualizations can be used to build simulations, create immersive experiences, and develop data-driven applications. These skills are useful in fields such as game development, user-interface design, and even data visualization, where presenting information clearly is essential.
